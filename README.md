## Trash City
Trash city is an endless, wave-based shooter game where you play as a fish that has been discared by its owner and must avoid getting pushed into the incinerator by dodging or destorying incoming trash. Move with A and D, jump with space, and shoot with the left mouse button. Ammo is limited so grab or shoot ammo pickups wherever you can.
